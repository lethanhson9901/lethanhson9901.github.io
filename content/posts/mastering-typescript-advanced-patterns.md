# Mastering TypeScript: Advanced Patterns and Best Practices

TypeScript has become an essential tool for building robust, scalable applications. In this guide, we'll explore advanced patterns and best practices that will take your TypeScript skills to the next level.

## Advanced Type Patterns

### Conditional Types

Conditional types allow you to create types that depend on a condition:

```typescript
type NonNullable<T> = T extends null | undefined ? never : T
type ApiResponse<T> = T extends string ? { message: T } : { data: T }
```

### Mapped Types

Transform existing types into new ones:

```typescript
type Partial<T> = {
  [P in keyof T]?: T[P]
}

type ReadOnly<T> = {
  readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P]
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Strict Mode

Always enable strict mode in your TypeScript configuration:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true
  }
}
```

### 2. Prefer Interfaces Over Types

Use interfaces for object shapes and types for unions:

```typescript
// Good
interface User {
  id: string
  name: string
  email: string
}

// Good
type Status = 'loading' | 'success' | 'error'
```

## Conclusion

These advanced TypeScript patterns will help you write more maintainable and type-safe code. Practice these concepts in your projects to become a TypeScript expert.
